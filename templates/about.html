        <h1>About</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The AIMS Research Group is a collaboration of four faculty and over 20 undergraduate research students in the
        Computer Science Department at the University of Wisconsin â€“ Eau Claire. Since its inception in Fall 2020 , it
        has engaged in multiple research projects that have yielded several student authored research publications at
        international conferences and Journals. Undergraduates participate as student researchers advised by the
        computer science faculty mentors, which are Rushit Dave (Chair), Jim Seliya, Mounika Vanamala, and Benjamin
        Fine. Each of the four faculty mentors brings their respective unique experience to the AIMS Research Group,
        providing a wide spectrum of research opportunities for undergraduates in the computing fields of artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, and security. A few of those research projects/areas are listed below,
        indicating the broad spectrum of research topics available to students. Several of the AIMS student researchers
        are recipients of the Karlgaard Scholarship. AIMS is proud of its extensive involvement of undergraduate
        students in novel scholastic work and promotes undergraduate research through ORSP-sponsored faculty-student
        collaboration research grants and diversity mentoring research programs. </p>
